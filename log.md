# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodeAcademy - HTML & CSS Part1 -Completed ID, Class, Div lesson; Started Box Model;    Portfolio project - Nav Bar basic set-up, used div to adjust overflow.

**Thoughts:**  Back at it.  Goal to use CodeAcademy courses to feed into completely FCC Personal Portfolio project.  It has been immensely helpful in learning CSS in more depth.  Getting the Nav Bar even basically set up made much more sense than the bootstrap code I found.  And it works! ** Would like to learn how to customize scroll bars..... Something to look into when I get into the making it pretty part. **

### Day 11: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Code Academy HTML CSS Intro (Finally.)  Finished a very basic portfolio page.

**Thoughts:**  Terrible gap in updating.  Due to crazy work schedules and tired, have not been as consistent on coding.  I feel like I have made progress on my personal portfolio. Finally got my portfolio/photos to layout properly.  Had issues with social media icons listings, was given bad advice about the order of <li> and <a> references.  It was actually a consolidation of html elements.  Font Awesome info showed using <i> command in addition to <a>, which caused issues.  Combining all of the elements to the a element fixed the problem.

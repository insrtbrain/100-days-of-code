# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodeAcademy - HTML & CSS Part1 -Completed ID, Class, Div lesson; Started Box Model;    Portfolio project - Nav Bar basic set-up, used div to adjust overflow.

**Thoughts:**  Back at it.  Goal to use CodeAcademy courses to feed into completely FCC Personal Portfolio project.  It has been immensely helpful in learning CSS in more depth.  Getting the Nav Bar even basically set up made much more sense than the bootstrap code I found.  And it works! ** Would like to learn how to customize scroll bars..... Something to look into when I get into the making it pretty part. **
